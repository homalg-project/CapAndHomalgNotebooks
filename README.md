## CAP and homalg based packages

This directory contains a collection of
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks demonstrating the
functionality of various [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) packages
hosted at the GitHub organisation https://github.com/homalg-project,
most of which are based on the

* [homalg project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project/),
* [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/).

These notebooks use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package
[HomalgProject](https://github.com/homalg-project/HomalgProject.jl).
