## CAP and homalg based Jupyter notebooks

This directory contains a collection of
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks demonstrating the
functionality of various [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) packages
hosted at the [GitHub organisation homalg-project](https://github.com/homalg-project),
most of which are based on the

* [homalg project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project/),
* [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/).

These notebooks use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package
[HomalgProject](https://github.com/homalg-project/HomalgProject.jl).

The notebooks are best viewed on the [jupyter nbviewer page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/homalg-project/CapHomalgNotebooks/tree/master/).
There you can also interactively run the notebooks online by clicking on `Binder`'s three-circle-logo (tooltip `Execute on Binder`) at the top-right corner.
